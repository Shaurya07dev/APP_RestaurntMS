 🍽️ Project Title:

Restaurant Management System with QR-Based Smart Ordering

💡 Concept Overview:

This project is a web-based restaurant management system designed to simplify the entire dining experience using QR-based ordering and digital payments.

Customers can scan a QR code placed on their table using their mobile camera, which automatically redirects them to the restaurant’s web app order page with the table number pre-filled.
They can then browse the digital menu, select items, and proceed to checkout — entering their email and mobile number for order confirmation and payment via Juspay HyperSwitch.

If a customer directly visits the order page, then they have to manually select table number.

All administrative features such as managing the menu, groceries, and tracking orders will be handled from a dedicated admin panel.

⚙️ Core Flow
👤 Customer Workflow:

🧱 Tech Stack
Component	Technology
Frontend	React (JSX)
Backend	Spring Boot (Java)
Database	PostgreSQL
Payment Gateway	Juspay HyperSwitch
QR Handling	Unique table QR → dynamic URL
Hosting	Vercel (Frontend), AWS/Render (Backend)
🔗 QR Code Mapping

Each table has a unique QR code encoded with its table number:
Example:

Table No.	QR Redirect URL
Table 1	https://yourrestaurant.com/order?table=1
Table 2	https://yourrestaurant.com/order?table=2
Table 3	https://yourrestaurant.com/order?table=3

When scanned, the frontend reads the table query parameter and pre-selects it for the order.

💳 Payment Flow

Customer selects items → proceeds to checkout

Enters email & phone number

Spring Boot backend initiates payment via Juspay API

Customer completes payment → Juspay sends callback to backend

Order status updates automatically → stored in PostgreSQ
